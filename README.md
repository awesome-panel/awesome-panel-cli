# ðŸšª Introduction Awesome Panel CLI

THIS PROJECT IS IN AN EARLY ALPHA STATE AND WILL CHANGE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

The aim of the `awesome-panel-cli` project is to turn any user of the CLI into a
highly productive developer of high quality Panel apps.

To do this the `awesome-panel-cli` provides an opinionated command line interface (CLI) `pn`.

For example you can create a new app as simple as

```bash
pn create app
```

This project draws inspiration from other CLI tools like

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli).
- [Django management commands](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [React Create App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

But the `awesome-panel-cli` also aims to provide additional, unique features like easy deployment.
